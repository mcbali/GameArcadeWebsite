# GameArcadeWebsite
This is a game arcade website with four games simple games implemented in JavaScript: Tic-Tac-Toe, Memory Match, Snake, and Flappy Bird. 

Flappy Bird files were adapted from another author: assebc.
Edits I made to Flappy Bird files:
- Changed CSS to match the theme of my website.
- Changed controls from spacebar to click because pressing the spacebar would scroll down the page.
- Provided comments to showcase my understanding of the code.
